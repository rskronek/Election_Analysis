## Summary
	Proposed script 
		1.) If the code is refactored to not have any hard coded references to the counties or to the candidates, then the commission could use the script     			 statewide.  
		2). The header row could be used to identify what columns contain candidate and county values which would provide flexibility so all CSV file do not 			 need the exact same format.
